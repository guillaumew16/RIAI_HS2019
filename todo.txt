- Use PGD to generate more test cases
- Test and make fixes for convolutional networks
- When noticed, mark suspicious lines as TODO or DEBUG with a comment
- Reduce the size of the computation graph of loss and znet

Todo before production:
- check for TODOs in the source
- remove or review lines marked with a "DEBUG" comment
- and obviously review the whole thing again
